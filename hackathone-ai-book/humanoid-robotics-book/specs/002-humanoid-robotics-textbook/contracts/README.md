# API Contracts

This project is a textbook delivered as a set of Markdown files. It does not include a public-facing API that requires formal contracts like OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas.

The "contracts" for this project are the educational modules and the learning outcomes defined in the feature specification. The structure of the textbook content is defined in the `data-model.md` file.
