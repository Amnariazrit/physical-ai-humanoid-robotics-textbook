# Contracts: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook\n\n**Feature Branch**: `1-robotics-textbook` | **Date**: 2025-12-05 | **Plan**: [specs/1-robotics-textbook/plan.md](specs/1-robotics-textbook/plan.md)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis directory serves to document \"contracts\" relevant to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Given that this project is a textbook and not a software application with external API endpoints, traditional API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas) are not applicable.\n\nInstead, \"contracts\" in this context refer to:\n\n1.  **Content Structure Contracts**: Implicit agreements on the consistent formatting and organization of Markdown modules, code examples, diagrams, and other content types within the Docusaurus framework.\n2.  **Tooling Integration Contracts**: Agreements on how various tools (e.g., Docusaurus, ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, AI diagram generators) interact and integrate to produce the final textbook and its accompanying assets.\n3.  **External Documentation Contracts**: References to the formal APIs and specifications of external systems (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim) that the textbook describes and interacts with.\n\n## Content Structure Agreements\n\n-   **Markdown Modules**: Each module (`.mdx` file) will adhere to a consistent frontmatter structure (e.g., title, description, sidebar\_label) and utilize specific Markdown/MDX components for elements like callouts, interactive examples, etc.\n-   **Code Examples**: All code examples will follow Python PEP 8 (or relevant language standards), include clear comments, and be self-contained or have explicitly defined dependencies.\n-   **Diagrams**: Diagrams will be SVG or PNG, adhere to a consistent visual style, and include `alt` text for accessibility.\n-   **Citations**: All citations will follow APA style guidelines, both inline and in a bibliography/references section.\n\n## Tooling Integration Notes\n\n-   **Docusaurus**: The primary content management and rendering framework. Contracts here involve adherence to its configuration (`docusaurus.config.js`), sidebar generation (`sidebars.js`), and component usage.\n-   **ROS 2 / Simulation**: Integration involves consistent directory structures for example packages and simulation assets, and clear instructions for setup and execution.\n-   **AI Diagram Generation**: Contracts with specific AI tools will ensure consistent output formats (SVG/PNG) and styles.\n
