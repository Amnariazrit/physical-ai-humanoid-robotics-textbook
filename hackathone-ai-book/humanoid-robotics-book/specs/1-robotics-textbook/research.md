# Research Findings: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Feature Branch**: `1-robotics-textbook` | **Date**: 2025-12-05 | **Plan**: [specs/1-robotics-textbook/plan.md](specs/1-robotics-textbook/plan.md)

## Overview

This document outlines research findings relevant to the development of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. Given the detailed nature of the feature specification, no critical ambiguities requiring deep research were identified at this stage. This section primarily serves as a placeholder for any future research that may arise during the detailed task breakdown or implementation phases regarding specific technical integrations or pedagogical approaches.

## Key Research Areas (Placeholder)

- **Docusaurus Best Practices for Academic Content**:  Investigate optimal configurations for Docusaurus to host multi-module academic content, including citation management, code block styling, and diagram integration.
- **ROS 2 and Simulation Environment Setup**: Research best practices for creating reproducible ROS 2 and simulation (Gazebo, Isaac Sim) environments, potentially leveraging Docker or other containerization technologies for student use.
- **AI-Generated Diagram Tools and Workflows**: Explore tools and workflows for generating high-quality, consistent diagrams (SVG/PNG) suitable for an academic textbook, ensuring no copyright infringements.
- **RAG Chatbot Indexing Strategies**: Research efficient and accurate methods for indexing Docusaurus-generated Markdown content for a RAG chatbot to achieve the 90%+ accuracy goal.

## Decisions and Rationale (Placeholder)

No immediate critical decisions requiring extensive research are pending, as the core technologies and scope are well-defined in the feature specification and implementation plan.

## Alternatives Considered (Placeholder)

N/A at this stage, as no specific open research questions have necessitated exploring alternatives beyond what's already outlined in the spec.
